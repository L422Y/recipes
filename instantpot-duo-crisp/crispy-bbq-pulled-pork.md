## Steps to Make Crispy Pulled Pork using Instant Pot Duo Crisp
Pressure-Cook Pork: Follow the above-mentioned steps for preparing and pressure-cooking the pork. Remove the pork and shred it.

Drain Excess Liquid: Before air frying, you might want to drain or remove some of the excess liquid to ensure crispiness. Leave a little bit for flavor and moisture.

Preheat Air Fryer Lid: Place the air fryer lid on your Instant Pot and set it to preheat at 400°F (200°C).

Prepare the Tray: Spread the shredded pork in a single layer on the air fryer tray or basket. You might want to do this in batches depending on the size of your tray.

Season Again (Optional): If you want to add more spices or sauces for additional flavor before crisping, now's the time. Just remember, extra sauce might make it less crispy.

Air Fry: Once preheated, insert the tray into the Instant Pot. Air fry the shredded pork for about 5-10 minutes at 400°F (200°C). Keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't burn. You can flip or stir halfway for even crisping.

Check & Serve: Check for your desired level of crispiness. If it's not crispy enough, you can air fry for another 2-5 minutes.

Final Touch: Once it's as crispy as you like, you might want to toss it in a tiny bit more BBQ sauce or any other sauce you prefer, though this is optional.
